# Shall we play a game? Rusty Tic Tac Toe

![tic-tac-toe-is-a-perfect-metaphor-for-the-cold-war-in-wargames-1326024890](https://github.com/calicojack1720/tic_tac_toe/assets/93363006/47389afc-af2f-4f92-bd15-70796f39b7cd)

This is a demo program that implements a game of Tic Tac Toe against a computer opponent that I wrote in Rust to try to teach myself the language. You can compile and build the
code using Cargo. To run the code in debug mode, use the command `Cargo run`. You can build an executable of the code using the `Cargo build` command.

## TODO
 - Add better instructions for how to play the game.
 - Handle non-numeric input without penalizing the player.
 - Refactor code.
 - Make the computer opponent more intelligent.
 - Add the ability to play against a second player or the computer.
 - Add the ability for the player to choose X's or O's.
